poor manâ€™s ruptime

Historically the original ruptime[^1] was using broadcast udp/513[^2] in a network.
Since it's not 1982 anymore, but 2022 today, here's a version for multiple networks with encrypted traffic and
client-server architecture.

You will automatically get instant list of hosts (down or up), inventory of hardware, software overview,
comparable list of benchmark results.

While it was
- rcp (remote copy)
- rexec (remote execution)
- rlogin (remote login)
- rsh (remote shell)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (remote who)
- rwall (remote wall)

It is now
- ruptime (remote uptime) - the classic
- runame (remote uname and OS/release) - keep track what OS/release you run
- rsw (remote software) - what kind of package managers did sneak in
- rhw (remote hardware, inventory) - what hardware you have
- rload (remote load of CPU/MEM/GPU/GPUMEM) - usage of hardware
- rbench (remote benchmark) - comparable list of your hardware
- rboot (remote rebootable?) - safety level for a reboot
- rnet (remote network) - networking details (interface name, connection speed)
- rdisk (remote disk) - overview of local disks and their speeds

## Never heard of ruptime, what does it look like?

The output shows how long the system has been up, the number of  users currently on the
system, and the load averages. The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the
run queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

```
$ ruptime # FQDN   State Uptime    Users    Load Averages 1' 5' 15'
dolphin.ocean.net   up   15+05:57  0 users  load 0.04 0.08 0.07
fish.ocean.net      up    4+21:27  0 users  load 0.22 0.25 0.25
tuna.ocean.net      up    4+21:27  0 users  load 0.20 0.30 0.42
```

```

## Command line options

```
-i   Install the software
-u   Upload information to the server (NOTE: this might require root permission and get restricted to the root user in the future)
-v   Print license/version and quit
```

No option queries the server for the information.

## Why would I want this?
- it's simple[^5]
- monitoring systems have no or not very useful CLI tools
- you don't want to manually keep a list of hosts
- you want to see what hosts are down
- you want to see what hosts are not idle
- you want to run something on all running hosts with `parallel`
- get rid of non-standard/in-house solutions that do not scale or are cumbersome in some other way

## Real life examples
Get an overview of your operating systems and releases
```
$ runame | awk '{i[$NF]++} END {for (n in i) print i[n] " " n}' | sort -nr
```

Find hosts that are least used by CPU
```
$ rload | sort -k2n
```

Update `rnet` output for all online hosts
```
# for a in `ruptime | grep -v " down " | awk '{print $1}'`; do echo $a; ssh root@$a "runame -u"; done
```

List all hosts sorted by network speed
```
$ rnet | sort -k3nr
```

Combined `ruptime` and `rload` output
```
$ join <(ruptime) <(rload) | column -t
```

Run something on all hosts having Ubuntu 22.04
```
# runame | grep jammy | awk '{print $1}' | parallel -j0 'ssh root@{} "something"'
```

Get total cores and memory of all your machines
```
$ rhw|awk '{print $3 " " $4}'|datamash -t" " sum 1-2
```

Average age of computers, oldest and newest (by BIOS date)
```
$ rhw|awk '{print $2}'|sed "s,/.*,,g"|datamash -t" " median 1 min 1 max 1
```

Right adjusted `rhw` output
```
$ rhw|column -t -R3,4
```

Sometimes `nl` or `ts` (from `moreutils`) are useful as well.

## Configuration
The defaults for rwhod/ruptime is downtime after 11' (11\*60 seconds)[^3] (ISDOWN), status messages are originally generated approximately every 3' (AL_INTERVAL)[^4].
```
SERVER=wedonthaveaprivacyproblem.com
PORT=51300
HOSTNAMECMD='hostname -f'
```

Create a key for the encryption with `mcrypt`. You will need this on server and client for symmetric encryption.
```
COLUMNS=160 dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=60 2>/dev/null > /etc/ruptime/ruptime.key
```

Create a local user to run the daemon.
```
adduser --disabled-password --quiet --system --home /var/spool/ruptime --gecos "ruptime daemon" --group ruptime
```

Running the daemon.
```
daemon --user=ruptime:ruptime mini-inetd 51300 /usr/sbin/ruptimed
```

## Requirements
- Client: `nc` `xz` `bc` `cron` `ethtool` `dmidecode` `memtester` `lm-sensors` `datamash` `nvidia-smi` `timeout` `mcrypt`
- Server: `nc` `xz` `tcputils` `daemon` `mcrypt`
- Optionals: `pen` `trickle` `bkt`

## Supported Systems
- macOS
- Linux
- FreeBSD
- Windows if someone implements uptime.exe (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-check-your-computer-uptime-windows-10#check_pc_uptime_cmd)

## Starting it
- FreeBSD: rc.d
- Linux: daemon, init.d, cron @reboot, systemd
- macOS: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-use-launchd-to-run-services-in-macos-b972ed1e352
- Windows (not sure if they still have `net start`, haven't seen it since NT 4)

- without systemd
```
# crontab -l
*/1 * * * *  /usr/bin/ruptime -u
*/3 * * * *  /usr/bin/rload -u
@reboot      /usr/bin/runame -u
@reboot      /usr/bin/rsw -u
```

Some metrics are not useful to have at regular intervals, nor at every boot, so collect them when needed, examples:

```
rboot -u
rnet -u
```

On first setup and hardware changes (memory upgrade, disks added):

```
rbench -u
rdisk -u
rhw -u
```
