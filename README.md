# ruptime
poor manâ€™s ruptime

Historically it is using broadcast udp/513 [3] in a network.
So this is a test how many machines it can take.

## Never heard of ruptime, what does it look like?
```
$ ruptime
fish             up    4+21:27,  0 users,  load 0.22, 0.25, 0.25
tuna             up    4+21:27,  0 users,  load 0.20, 0.25, 0.25
dolphin          up   15+05:57,  0 users,  load 0.04, 0.08, 0.07
```

## Why would I want this?
- it's simple [4]
- monitoring systems have no or not very useful CLI tools
- you don't want to manually keep a list of hosts
- you want to see what hosts are down
- you want to see what hosts are not idle
- you want to run something on all running hosts with `parallel`

## Configuration
The defaults for rwhod/ruptime is downtime after 11' (11\*60 seconds) [1] (ISDOWN), status messages are originally generated approximately every 3' (AL_INTERVAL) [2].
```
SERVER=wedonthaveaprivacyproblem.com
PORT=51300
HOSTNAMECMD='hostname -f'
```

Create a key for the encryption with mcrypt. You will need this on server and client for symmetric encryption.
```
COLUMNS=160 dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=60 2>/dev/null > /etc/ruptime/ruptime.key
```

## Requirements
- Client: `nc` `mcrypt`
- Server: `nc` `xz` `tcputils` `daemon` `mcrypt`
- Optionals: `pen` `trickle`

## Supported Systems
- macOS
- Linux
- FreeBSD
- Windows if someone implements uptime.exe (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-check-your-computer-uptime-windows-10#check_pc_uptime_cmd)

## Starting it
- FreeBSD: rc.d
- Linux: daemon, init.d, cron @reboot, systemd [5]
- macOS: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-use-launchd-to-run-services-in-macos-b972ed1e352
- Windows (not sure if they still have `net start`, haven't seen it since NT 4)

```
crontab -l
*/3 * * * * /usr/bin/ruptime -u
```
