poor manâ€™s ruptime

Historically the original ruptime[^1] was using broadcast udp/513[^2] in a network.
Since it's not 1982 anymore, but 2022 today, here's a version for multiple networks with encrypted traffic and
client-server architecture.

You will automatically get instant list of hosts (down or up), inventory of hardware, software overview,
comparable list of benchmark results.

While it was
- rcp (remote copy)
- rexec (remote execution)
- rlogin (remote login)
- rsh (remote shell)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (remote who)

It is now
- ruptime (remote uptime) - the classic
- runame (remote uname and OS/release) - keep track what OS/release you run
- rsw (remote software) - what kind of package managers did sneak in
- rhw (remote hardware, inventory) - what hardware do you have
- rload (remote load of CPU/GPU/MEM/NET) - the current usage of hardware
- rbench (remote benchmark) - comparable list of your hardware if you need something
- rboot (remote rebootable?) - safety level for a reboot
- rnet (remote network) - networking details (interface name, connection speed)
- rdisk (remote disk) - overview of local disks and their speeds

## Never heard of ruptime, what does it look like?
```
$ ruptime
fish.ocean.net      up    4+21:27  0 users  load 0.22 0.25 0.25
tuna.ocean.net      up    4+21:27  0 users  load 0.20 0.30 0.42
dolphin.ocean.net   up   15+05:57  0 users  load 0.04 0.08 0.07
```

## Why would I want this?
- it's simple[^5]
- monitoring systems have no or not very useful CLI tools
- you don't want to manually keep a list of hosts
- you want to see what hosts are down
- you want to see what hosts are not idle
- you want to run something on all running hosts with `parallel`
- get rid of non-standard/in-house solutions that do not scale or are cumbersome in some other way

## Plan

- allow to monitor custom variables
- web presentation/views
- replace `mcrypt` with `openssl`

## Configuration
The defaults for rwhod/ruptime is downtime after 11' (11\*60 seconds)[^3] (ISDOWN), status messages are originally generated approximately every 3' (AL_INTERVAL)[^4].
```
SERVER=wedonthaveaprivacyproblem.com
PORT=51300
HOSTNAMECMD='hostname -f'
```

Create a key for the encryption with `mcrypt`. You will need this on server and client for symmetric encryption.
```
COLUMNS=160 dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=60 2>/dev/null > /etc/ruptime/ruptime.key
```

Create a local user to run the daemon.
```
adduser --disabled-password --quiet --system --home /var/spool/ruptime --gecos "ruptime daemon" --group ruptime
```

Running the daemon.
```
daemon --user=ruptime:ruptime mini-inetd 51300 /usr/sbin/ruptimed
```

## Requirements
- Client: `nc` `mcrypt`
- Server: `nc` `xz` `tcputils` `daemon` `mcrypt`
- Optionals: `pen` `trickle` `timeout`

## Supported Systems
- macOS
- Linux
- FreeBSD
- Windows if someone implements uptime.exe (https://www.windowscentral.com/how-check-your-computer-uptime-windows-10#check_pc_uptime_cmd)

## Starting it
- FreeBSD: rc.d
- Linux: daemon, init.d, cron @reboot, systemd[^6]
- macOS: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-use-launchd-to-run-services-in-macos-b972ed1e352
- Windows (not sure if they still have `net start`, haven't seen it since NT 4)

- without systemd
```
crontab -l
